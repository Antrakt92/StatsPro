# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed

- **Single-column layout when only one display dimension is on** — toggling either
  `Show Rating` or `Show Percentage` off now stacks every visible number in a single
  RIGHT-justified column (the rating column). Previously, non-rating rows (Primary
  stats, Defensives, Durability, Repair) still rendered in the value column, which
  collapsed to a degenerate empty layout when most rows were empty there — leaving
  visible gaps and, in the rating-only case, truncating Durability's percentage.

### Fixed

- **Wide gap / truncated percentage in single-display modes** — `FontString:GetString-
  Width()` on a mostly-empty multi-line string (e.g. `"\n\n\n92.3%"`) is unreliable
  in 12.x retail, leaving cached column widths stale and the panel layout broken.
  `FmtRatingPct`, `FmtPctOnly`, and the inline Primary/Armor/Durability/Repair pushes
  now route their value into the rating column whenever the dual-column mode is off,
  and `UpdateStats` passes a literal `""` to the value FontString in that case —
  bypassing the unreliable measurement entirely.

## 1.0.0 — Initial release

First public release under the StatsPro name. Originally inspired by SwiftStats v2.1
by TaylorSay (MIT) — substantially rewritten, with only ~9% of upstream code remaining
verbatim (boilerplate, color defaults, basic stat list). Everything below is original
work added on top of (or in place of) the upstream foundation.

### Added

- **Defensive stats panel** — Dodge, Parry, Block, Armor (as % damage reduction).
  Independent visibility toggle from the offensive stats; per-stat color swatches; hide-zero option.
- **Durability tracking** — single-pass scan of equipment slots (skipping shirt/tabard),
  with toggle between average and worst-slot percentage. Vendor-format precision (`%.1f%%`).
- **Auto-color durability** — green ≥60%, yellow ≥30%, red <30%. Override available
  by disabling auto-color and picking a custom color.
- **Repair cost** — live vendor-format coin string using `GetCoinTextureString` with
  inline gold/silver/copper icons. Rendered on its own line below durability to avoid truncation.
- **Display modes** — three layouts: Flat (one panel, all stats), Sectioned (one panel
  with `— Defensive —` divider), Split (separate draggable panels for offensive/defensive).
- **Multi-panel positioning** — defensive panel is independently draggable when in Split mode.
- **Master visibility toggle** — show/hide all panels with a single checkbox or `/ss toggle`.
- **Settings UI rewrite** — three-tab config window (Display / Stats / Defensive) with
  inline color swatches, dependency-aware enable/disable (Repair Cost greyed out when
  Durability is off, durability swatch greyed when Auto Color is on).

### Changed

- **Default text alignment** — `RIGHT` (was `LEFT`). Migrated automatically for users
  on the old default; explicit user choices preserved.
- **Effective armor handling** — uses `pcall(UnitArmor)` and filters secret values for
  12.x retail compatibility. Refresh runs out-of-combat only.
- **Versatility** — split into rating + flat dual-source display, with combat-safe caching
  (recompute OOC, use cached value in combat).
- **Repair cost API** — switched from `GameTooltip:SetInventoryItem` (returns secret
  values in 12.x) to `C_TooltipInfo.GetInventoryItem` + `TooltipUtil.SurfaceArgs`.

### Fixed

- **Misaligned rating + percentage columns** — when both "Show Rating" and "Show Percentage"
  were on, the `|` separator and percent values drifted horizontally row-to-row because
  rating widths varied (46 vs 843). Rating is now its own RIGHT-justified third FontString
  between label and value, so all rating right-edges line up vertically and the percent
  column has a clean fixed left edge.
- **Frame position not persisting** — `SetUserPlaced(true)` now called after `SetPoint(...)`
  in `LoadPosition`, ensuring 12.x retail correctly commits the user's drag-saved anchor.
- **Position lost on /reload** — `PLAYER_LOGOUT` handler now saves both panels
  defensively, in case the user drags via paths that bypass `OnDragStop`.
- **Durability % differing from vendor** — default switched to average (matching the vendor
  display); worst-slot mode preserved as opt-in.
- **In-combat secret-value taint** — every stat-API read (`GetCombatRating`,
  `GetUnitMaxHealthModifier`, `UnitArmor`, `GetUnitSpeed`, etc.) now passes through
  `pcall` + `issecretvalue` filtering before any arithmetic or comparison.

### Migrated

- Existing **SwiftStatsLocal** users keep all their settings — `StatsProDB` is populated
  from `SwiftStatsLocalDB` on first load if present. Old DB is left untouched.
